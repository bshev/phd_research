Repo for old code, from physics PhD research:

## Project Notebooks

### AverageUnitCellNanotube
- Using template matching to extract unit cells of 1D crystallite chains inside of nanotubes in HRSTEM images and creating an average composite super resolution image and figure.

### datCasinoToh5
- Parsing utility to convert `.dat` files to `.h5`. Data generated using CASINO software simulating electrons in a SEM incident on a multilayer substrate.

### hBNonSiSEMTrajectories
- Visualization of SEM electron trajectories inside a typical semiconducting multilayer sample.

### HRSTEMAtoms
- Analysis of an atomic resolution HRSTEM image. Identifying all atomic columns and fitting 2D Gaussian curves to each to extract properties of the material.

### NanoparticleSizeDistribution
- Using thresholding and region analysis on STEM images of nanoparticle films to get statistical properties of synthesis runs.
